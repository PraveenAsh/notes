# HCI Notes CS6750
#### "CS6750 is a journey, not a destination" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
Course goals : To design effective interactions between humans and computers


Important terms :
>1. Invisibility :  The interface between the human and the computer has to invisible so that the user can concentrate on achieving the task with minimal ambiguity.
>2. Ubiquitiy : The state and capcity of being everywhere. In HCI context, computers are everywhere, so interaction between them is inevitable.

### Points to ponder :
##### Lesson 1:
>* UI vs HCI : UI concentrates on building a system within the computer's single screen but HCI is beyond just it. There defined rules for a UI System like Fluent design by Microsoft. Developed technique and interafaces that are responsive for users to use. Mostly through the use of pen and paper or wireframes.
>* UX vs HCI : HCI is understanding the interaction but UX is dictating the interactions. In UX there is definite need to understand the users. The relationship symbyotic here. UX is to evalute. Based on the success or failure HCI is needed to incorporate it.
>* Experince leads to understanding the physcology of interaction.
>* HCI Two things 
>>* 1. Research
>>* 2. Design.

##### Lesson 2 and 3:
>* Design : An initiative process of needfinding, prototyping, evaluating and revising.
>* Two things : Apply know principles filtered over decades, use feedback to reshape and create new principles.
>* Learning by Example, Doing, Reflection.
>* Peer Learning, Collaborative learning, learning by teaching, Communities of practice.
>* Context-sensitve computing : Equipping user interfaces with historical, geographical,or others forms of contextual knowledge.
